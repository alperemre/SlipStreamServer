;; Inserts in db usage records and retrieves them for a given interval.
;; 
;; 2 kind of insertion are possible:
;; * we store the start of a usage record (no end-timestamp yet)
;; * we "close" this usage record by assigning its end-timestamp.
;;
;; The usage-records is projected onto its metric dimensions, that means that
;; an original event on 3 dimensions will end up being stored as 3 rows.
;;
;; The records-for-interval retrieves the usage-records for a given interval.
;; (i.e records whose [start-end timestamps] intersect with the interval)
