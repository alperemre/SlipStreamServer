## Usages

### Usage Records

`Usage records` represent the most atomic piece of information regarding usages.
It is a REST resource managed by the API server. As it is a technical resource (used only internally by Web Server and 
not exposed to SlipStream users, only POST operation is currently supported). 

A usage record is typically created by Web server during the lifecycle of a VM.
A POST is made with a new usage record (that does not contain an end_timestamp) when a VM is started.
When it is stopped, another POST is made with the same information but including the end_timestamp.
See UsageRecorder class for more details.

**Note that a single usage record is stored in database on multiple rows (one for each metric).**

To see in database, some useful commands:

How many usage records:

```
java -jar /opt/hsqldb/lib/sqltool.jar --inlineRc=url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001/ssclj,user=sa,password= --sql 'select count(*) from "usage_records";'
``

Some (limited to 10) usage records for `ixsq_dev` on `ec2-eu-west`:

```
java -jar /opt/hsqldb/lib/sqltool.jar --inlineRc=url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001/ssclj,user=sa,password= --sql "select * from \"usage_records\" where \"cloud\"='ec2-eu-west' and \"user\"='sixsq_dev' limit 10;"
```

### Usage summaries

This is also a REST resource.

A Usage Summary is the aggregation of all metrics for a given time interval, user and cloud.
e.g:

One usage summary

{"vm":{"unit_minutes":1440.0},
 "ram":{"unit_minutes":4.718592E7},
 "disk":{"unit_minutes":0.0},
 "instance-type.Huge":{"unit_minutes":1440.0}}


### Process

#### Computation of Usage Summaries

Each day at 2 AM (UTC), a cron job computes and stores the summaries for all users on each cloud.
Here are the details of the execution on nuv.la:

```
cron job: 
/etc/cron.d/create-daily-usage 

--> triggers at 2 AM

/usr/sbin/create-daily-usage.sh (simple wrapper around clojure launcher without arguments)

--> that calls  

com.sixsq.slipstream.ssclj.usage.daily_summary_launcher
```

`daily_summary_launcher` by default (no arguments) computes the summaries for yesterday.
It can also be called with optional arguments `-d date`
e.g: 

```
daily_summary_launcher -d 20150921
```

#### Send Usage emails

Each day at 3 AM, a cron job sends via email (to users having set the preference) these usage summaries.
Here are the details of the execution on nuv.la:

cron job:
/etc/cron.d/daily-usage-emails

--> triggers at 3 AM

/usr/sbin/send-daily-usage-emails.sh

--> that calls

com.sixsq.slipstream.action.DailyUsageSender (Java class actually doing the job)

The DailyUsageSender queries the Usage Summary resource with the help of the CIMI filter.
