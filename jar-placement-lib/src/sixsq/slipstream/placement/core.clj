  Entry point is place-and-rank.
  Responsibility is to price given components on all given connectors.
  Each component explicits its preferred instance type per connector.
  Strategy to price one component
    * find the list of 'eligible' service offers. (a service offer that fulfill component contrainsts,
      or a service offer chosen by instance type).
    * for each connector the component is priced on the smallest service offer
